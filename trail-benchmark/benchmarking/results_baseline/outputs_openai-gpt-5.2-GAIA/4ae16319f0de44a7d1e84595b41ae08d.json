In other words, it took 30 years for that change to occur.",
      "description": "The agent asserts specific historical details (time period, endpoints 37% to 24%, and the duration 'three decades') purely from memory without citing or retrieving the Girls Who Code source. The trace contains no web browsing or document inspection that would justify these claims, so the answer is effectively an unverified hallucination even if it might coincidentally match the ground truth.",

      "description": "The system instruction emphasized running verification steps as needed and the agent's own plan required using the search_agent to locate and verify the Girls Who Code source and extract the relevant years. The agent did not call search_agent (or any other verification tool) and jumped directly to a final answer, failing to follow the intended tool-based verification workflow.",

      "description": "Instead of executing the planned subtasks (find source, extract years, compute difference, verify), the agent deviated to producing an immediate answer. This indicates failure in task management/progress monitoring: the system did not carry out the necessary intermediate steps to achieve the goal reliably.",

It also violated the required code-block termination format (<end_code>).",
