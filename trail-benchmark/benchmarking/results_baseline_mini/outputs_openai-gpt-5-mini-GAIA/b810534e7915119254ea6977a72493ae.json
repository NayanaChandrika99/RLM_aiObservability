It is known that Tropicos – the botanical database provided by the Missouri Botanical Garden – assigns unique numeric IDs to taxa; for Helotiales the ID is given at https://www.tropicos.org/Name/40025482.

The agent used a computation tool (python interpreter) to compute the check digit based on that asserted ID rather than selecting a web/search tool to confirm the identifier.

The execution, however, did not orchestrate that subtask (no search_agent or web-search tool call appears to have been executed to satisfy step 1).

The agent re-injected the same facts/plans multiple times and did not use the available context to perform the planned web lookup step.
