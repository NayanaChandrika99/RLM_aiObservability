            "instruction_adherence_reasoning": "The agent followed the high-level task (identified the non-equivalent statement and returned the required final-answer string). However, it violated some protocol-level formatting instructions (missing '<end_code>' markers) and the environment/tool documentation contained contradictory instructions, which reduce strict adherence to the full instruction set.",

Plan optimality is reduced by excessive nested prompt material and reliance on lengthy in-conversation examples, and by the tooling/documentation inconsistencies that could have led to unnecessary tool calls or confusion.",
