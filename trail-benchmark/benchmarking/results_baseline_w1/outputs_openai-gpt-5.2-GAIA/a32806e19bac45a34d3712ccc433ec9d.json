      "instruction_adherence_reasoning": "Although the agent follows the general workflow (planning and attempting to use a search agent), it violates the core instruction to verify and ensure correctness before answering, and it proceeds to a definitive answer after an explicit failure-to-find from the search agent.",

The agent then abandons the plan and guesses.",
