      "description": "The agent misidentified the grammatical roles implied by the prompt’s ‘is pleasing to’ note. If the experiencer (the one who likes) is treated as the object, then in “I like apples” the direct object should be ‘I’ (accusative: Mato) and the subject should be ‘apples’ (nominative: Apple). The agent instead treated ‘apples’ as the direct object and ‘I’ as the subject, producing an incorrect translation.",
