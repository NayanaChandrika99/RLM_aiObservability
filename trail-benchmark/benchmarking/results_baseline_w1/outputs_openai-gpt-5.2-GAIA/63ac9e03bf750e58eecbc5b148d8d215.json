      "description": "The agent misread the constraint. The original problem states “one box must contain at least 2 coins” (i.e., at least one box has >=2), which is effectively always true given 30 coins across 3 boxes (unless negative coins were allowed). Many intended versions of this classic problem require “each box must contain at least 2 coins.” The agent’s later reasoning and code proceed with the weaker (and essentially non-restrictive) constraint, changing the game’s feasible set and the minimax result.",

      "description": "The tool output is based on the agent’s incorrect constraint implementation (treating the “>=2 coins” condition as applying to at least one box, and implementing it incorrectly as max(a,b,c) < 2). The agent accepts the computed optimum as authoritative without validating that the constraints match the problem statement, so the result is not reliable for the intended task.",

      "description": "The agent asserts a computed result ($16,000) that contradicts its own subsequent executed code output ($10,000). This is an ungrounded claim/hallucination relative to the trace evidence and indicates inconsistent reasoning about the computed optimum.",

The agent’s code uses a keyword argument 'answer', but the actual tool invocation recorded shows positional args were used (\"args\": [\"$10,000\"]).
