However, the trace shows minor process/format issues in intermediate planning output, which slightly reduces confidence in strict compliance but not in the final answer correctness.",

      "instruction_adherence_reasoning": "The agent failed to follow an explicit instruction to end the plan with the '<end_plan>' tag and stop, which is a direct non-compliance in an intermediate step. Other core task instructions (provide the full statement that doesn't fit) were satisfied in the final answer.",
