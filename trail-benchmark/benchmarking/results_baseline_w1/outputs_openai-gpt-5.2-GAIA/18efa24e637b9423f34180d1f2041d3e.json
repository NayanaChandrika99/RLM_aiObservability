The question is ambiguous (could mean the latest 2022 version of the Lego article, or the latest article in 2022 about Lego, etc.). The agent did not disambiguate by checking what \"latest 2022 Lego english wikipedia article\" means (e.g., via revision history UI, page statistics, or explicit definition) and did not confirm that the target page is indeed the intended one.",

This likely overcounts because Wikipedia pages include UI/icons, tracking pixels, and other non-content images, and may include duplicates or images outside the article content.

The agent also did not properly disambiguate what \"latest 2022 Lego english wikipedia article\" refers to, making the result highly likely to be incorrect relative to the intended question.",

      "instruction_adherence_reasoning": "The agent attempted an explicitly disallowed import (from final_answer import final_answer), causing execution failure.
