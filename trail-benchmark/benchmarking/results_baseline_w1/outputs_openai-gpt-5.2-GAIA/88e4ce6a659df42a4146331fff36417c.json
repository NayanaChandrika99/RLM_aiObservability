It should have invoked the available team member (search_agent) to browse the web, but instead used the python interpreter tool to print text, which cannot retrieve web information. This is a tool selection/usage error because the chosen tool cannot accomplish the intended subtask (web search).",

      "description": "Instead of executing the planned subtasks (find USGS source, verify, extract year), the agent spent multiple steps generating and printing messages, without progressing toward obtaining the needed evidence. This deviates from the task goal of actually determining the year from USGS records.",
